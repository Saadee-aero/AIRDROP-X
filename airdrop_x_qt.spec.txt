PyInstaller quick-start notes for AIRDROP-X Qt app
===================================================

A full spec file is provided: airdrop_x_qt.spec. Use it to build the
one-folder Windows bundle (qt_app.py as entrypoint).

Install PyInstaller (optional, for packaging only):

    pip install pyinstaller

Build from project root
-----------------------

    pyinstaller --noconfirm --clean airdrop_x_qt.spec

Or without the spec file (minimal):

    pyinstaller --noconfirm --clean --name AIRDROP-X --windowed qt_app.py

Key notes
---------

- Entry point: `qt_app.py` (creates QApplication and AirdropMainWindow).
- Required Python packages at build time:
  - PyQt6
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
- The engine, Monte Carlo, and decision logic are imported as normal
  Python modules; no special hooks are required for them.
- If matplotlib backends cause warnings, ensure `matplotlib.backends`
  is collected by PyInstaller (recent versions handle this automatically).

After running the command, the standalone EXE will be placed under
`dist/AIRDROP-X/` on Windows.
