# AIRDROP-X Simulation Framework

Probabilistic guidance and decision-support simulation for precision
unpowered payload delivery from UAV platforms.

## Overview
This repository contains a physics-based simulation framework for
modeling unpowered payload trajectories under uncertainty and
evaluating drop/no-drop decisions using probabilistic metrics.

## Current Status
- Monte Carlo trajectory simulation
- Hit probability estimation
- User-defined decision threshold (in progress)

## Disclaimer
This project is intended for research and simulation purposes only.
No autonomous release or weapon control functionality is implemented.
# AIRDROP-X-Simulation
Physics-based Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic airdrop decision support.
