"""
Standard, drone-agnostic telemetry data contract for AIRDROP-X.

This module defines:

- `TelemetryFrame`: one immutable snapshot of vehicle state as seen by the
  ground station at a point in time.
- `TelemetrySource`: abstract base class for any source of telemetry frames
  (log replay, network link, simulation, etc.).

No physics, filtering, or decision logic is implemented here. This is a pure
data/interface definition layer and remains UAV- and hardware-agnostic.

    """
    One telemetry snapshot as seen by AIRDROP-X at a given time.

    All units and frames are explicitly documented to support auditability.

    Attributes
    ----------
    timestamp : float
        Wall-clock time in **seconds**. Interpretation (e.g. UNIX epoch vs
        mission-relative) is defined by the TelemetrySource, but MUST be
        consistent for a given run.

    position : (float, float, float)
        Vehicle position in **meters** in a local Cartesian frame:
        - x: forward
        - y: right
        - z: up

        NOTE: This is intentionally generic and drone-agnostic. Any mapping
        from a specific UAV or navigation frame into this local frame MUST be
        performed outside this module.

    velocity : (float, float, float)
        Vehicle translational velocity in **meters per second (m/s)** in the
        same local Cartesian frame as `position`:
        - vx: forward component (m/s)
        - vy: right component (m/s)
        - vz: up component (m/s)

    attitude : (float, float, float)
        Vehicle attitude expressed as **roll, pitch, yaw** in **radians**:
        - roll: rotation about x-axis (right-hand rule)
        - pitch: rotation about y-axis (right-hand rule)
        - yaw: rotation about z-axis (right-hand rule)

        This is a generic aerospace-style convention and does not assume any
        specific autopilot or UAV implementation.

    source : str
        Label describing the origin of this frame, for example:
        - \"measured\"  : directly reported by sensors / GNSS / IMU
        - \"estimated\" : fused or filtered estimate
        - \"replayed\"  : from a log file
        - \"simulated\" : from an offline simulation

        AIRDROP-X treats this as metadata only; no behavior is implied.
